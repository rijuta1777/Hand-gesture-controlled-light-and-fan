# Hand-gesture-controlled-light-and-fan
This project simulates a hand gesture-controlled system for operating lights and fans. It focuses on the software side â€” detecting hand gestures through a camera or input data and triggering corresponding control actions. Built using Python (and OpenCV if applicable), it demonstrates how gesture recognition can be used for smart home automation.
